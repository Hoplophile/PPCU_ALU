xmelab: *W,NOTVFW (../tb/mtm_Alu_tb.v,478|9): Expecting a SystemVerilog void function name. The task 'CRC3_37' should be made a void function, not a task. Currently this is treated as a warning for backward compatibility but be aware that calling a task in this context is illegal SystemVerilog and can give unpredictable results. Further, this condition may be treated as an error in the future.
